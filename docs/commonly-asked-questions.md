## Configure OpenVSwitch

Visualisation des configurations des ports
```bash
ovs-vsctl list interface eth1

# Voir seulement les options configurées
ovs-vsctl get interface eth1 options

# Voir la vitesse configurée
ovs-vsctl get interface eth1 options:link_speed
ovs-vsctl get interface eth1 options:duplex
```

Liste des bridges et de ses ports
```bash
ovs-vsctl list-br  # Liste des bridges
ovs-vsctl list-ports br0  # Ports d'un bridge spécifique
```
    
Configurer la vitesse d'un port et son duplex
```bash
ovs-vsctl set interface eth1 options:link_speed=100
ovs-vsctl set interface eth1 options:duplex=full
```
Ou en une seule commande :
```bash
ovs-vsctl set interface eth1 options:link_speed=100 options:duplex=full
```
