In RemoteLabz, administrators can manage the amount of memory (RAM) and possibly disk space allocated to a device through different presets called flavors. By default, five differents flavors are provided with RemoteLabz  :
 
 * **xx-small-256** : allocate 256 megabytes of RAM.
 * **x-small-512** : allocate 512 megabytes of RAM.
 * **small-1024** :  allocate 1024 megabytes of RAM.
 * **large-2048** : allocate 2048 megabytes of RAM (2 GB).
 * **x-large** : allocate 4092 megabytes of RAM (4 GB).
 
 In the lab editor, when creating a device you have to allocate one of these different flavors.
