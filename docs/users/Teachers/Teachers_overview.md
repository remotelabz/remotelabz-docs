## Profile restriction
In both profiles, a teacher cannot :

* manage users (deleting or modifying a user)
* manage worker and database 

Only the administrator of the application can add new operating systems and new device templates. The teacher has to ask to his administrator if he need new virtual machine with a specific configuration.
