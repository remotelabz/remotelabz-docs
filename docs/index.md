==========

[RemoteLabz](https://remotelabz.com){:target="_blank"} is an application designed to help students, directed by a teacher, to experiment program, to develop their computer code, to practice finding vulnerabilities in an information system, to follow a tutorial, or to learn new knowledge in a virtual environment and without nor modification of their system, neither risk for the virtual environment. Each time the student finishes its works, all the virtual environment he has used is destroyed.
    
The first version, created in 2009, was coded in J2EE, allowing to control real equipment. The tools used by this first version are still in use but we did not use the application for security reasons. The J2EE version used is now obsolete and has many security flaws.

In 2017, a 2nd version was completely rewritten to adapt to the needs of IT training: Carry out practical work in a work environment, pre-configured and without any risk to one's personal computer.
