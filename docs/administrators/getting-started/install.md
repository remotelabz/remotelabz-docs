# Installation
## General informations
RemoteLabz needs at least 2 hosts :
 
- 1 for the web site, called the RemoteLabz's front.
- 1 for the server which execute the virtuals machines, called *remotelabz-worker*.


!!! info
    Technically, you may be able to use only one host for all services, but since remotelabz-worker has to run QEMU, we recommend to use a different server for each service.

The front can be a virtual machine and it will be the only host with an access from Internet. So, you have to secure your ssh service with the lastest recommandation and we recommand you to install a [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) service for example.
