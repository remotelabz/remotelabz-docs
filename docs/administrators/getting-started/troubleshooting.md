## Error with numpy when installing

If the setup fails while processing numpy-2.1.3.tar.gz with this error:
    
`error: Couldn't find a setup script in /tmp/easy_install-cw60uo3_/numpy-2.1.3.tar.gz

 Install numpy manually with `pip install numpy.` and re-run the installation script.
    
## lxc error while creating alpine 3.15 when installing

This is due to the script asking to install a version of Alpine that is no longer maintained.
To circumvent this, the install script must be modified.
Open the install script and change those lines

```bash
LXC=`lxc-ls -name "Alpine3.15"`;
if [ "${LXC}" == "" ] ; then
echo "Creation of a container Alpine 3.15"
DOWNLOAD_KEYSERVER="keyserver.ubuntu.com" lxc-create -t download -n Alpine3.15 -- -d alpine -r 3.15 -a amd64
echo "No default login, please use Sandbox to configure a new OS from this" >> "/var/lib/lxc/Alpine3.15/rootfs/etc/issue"
echo "nameserver 1.1.1.3" > "/var/lib/lxc/Alpine3.15/rootfs/etc/resolv.conf"
echo "OK ✔️"
fi;    
```
to

```bash
LXC=`lxc-ls -name "Alpine3.17"`;
if [ "${LXC}" == "" ] ; then
echo "Creation of a container Alpine 3.17"
DOWNLOAD_KEYSERVER="keyserver.ubuntu.com" lxc-create -t download -n Alpine3.17 -- -d alpine -r 3.17 -a amd64
echo "No default login, please use Sandbox to configure a new OS from this" >> "/var/lib/lxc/Alpine3.17/rootfs/etc/issue"
echo "nameserver 1.1.1.3" > "/var/lib/lxc/Alpine3.17/rootfs/etc/resolv.conf"
echo "OK ✔️"
fi;
```

This will force the installer to install a version of Alpine that is still maintained (3.17).
Re-run the install script after this.

## 2 VM with the same address

Even if your two VMs have different MAC address on its interface, from Ubuntu 16, the DHCP client send, not your MAC address but an information stores in the /etc/machine-id . So, when you put 2 times the same VM in a same lab, you have to, either change the machine-id value or change your /etc/netplan/ file :

```bash
      dhcp4: yes
      dhcp-identifier: mac
```

## Error in sync OS

```bash
sudo chown :remotelabz-worker /var/lib/lxc
sudo chmod g+w /var/lib/lxc
```
